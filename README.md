Note: If providing a post_status of 'future' you must specify the post_date in order for WordPress to know when to publish your post.
Note: If the post_type value is `attachment`, you can use `post_thumbnail` field to define media URL or path.

== Installation ==

1. Upload All files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the Import page under Tools menu.
4. Click CSV link, read the notification, then just upload and import.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I fill all columns of post data? =

No. Only columns which you want to update.

= Can I update existing post data? =

Yes. Please use ID field to specify the existing post.

= Can I insert post with specific post id? =

Yes. Please use ID field to specify the new post ID.

= Can I import custom field/custom taxonomy of the post? =

Yes. You can use column names same as wp_post table, but if the column name does not match, it creates a custom field (post meta) data. Importing custom taxonomy is a bit more complicated, "tax_{taxonomy}" means, "tax_" is prefix, and {taxonomy} is name of custom taxonomy (not labels).

Here is an example.

**csv file**  
"post_title","released","tax_actors"  
"Captain Phillips","2013","Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman"  

**imported post data**  
Post Title: Captain Phillips  
Custom field "released": 2013  
Custom taxonomy "Actors": Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman

= Why should I quote text cells when I save csv file? =

Because PHP cannot read multibyte text cells in some cases.

> Locale setting is taken into account by this function. If LANG is e.g. en_US.UTF-8, files in one-byte encoding are read wrong by this function.

= Can I insert multiple values to CFS or ACF fields like Select or Checkbox? =

Yes. Please create additional plugin and use `really_simple_csv_importer_save_meta` filter to make array data.
